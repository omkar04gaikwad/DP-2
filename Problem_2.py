Time Complexity - O(n), where n = number of houses
Space Complexity - O(n), for the dp table of size n x 3

Approach -
- Each house can be painted with Red (0), Blue (1), or Green (2).
- Constraint: No two adjacent houses can be painted with the same color.
- I create a DP table where:
    - dp[i][0] = min total cost to paint house i red
    - dp[i][1] = min total cost to paint house i blue
    - dp[i][2] = min total cost to paint house i green
- Base case: dp[0] = costs[0] â†’ initial painting costs for the first house
- For each house from i=1 to n:
    - I choose the current color and add the minimum cost from the two previous different colors.
    - This ensures no two adjacent houses have the same color.
- Finally, I return the minimum value among the last house's three color choices.
